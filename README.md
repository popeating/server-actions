## Next.js CRUD with Server Actions

This repo contains the code to follow my tutorial on implementing Server Actions in Next.js for a fully functional C.R.U.D. application.

This tutorail works with:
- Next.js 13/14 with server actions enabled (if working with Next.js 13) https://nextjs.org/
- a Mongodb Database. The tutorial is implemented on a Mongodb database, but using another database it's just a matter of changing the connection and queries
- Tailwind CSS + Daisy UI for style
- React Hook Form for form implementation
- Zod for client side validation
- mongoose to manage Schema and DB connection
- React Icons for styling


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
